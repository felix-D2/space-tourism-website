    <h3>Space capsule</h3>

    A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
    capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
    you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
    and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
